The slice contains LUT-RAMs but none of them occupy the HLUT. A HLUT RAM is needed to provide write address signals to the rest of the RAM

LUTRAMs which are in the slice and are primitive macros we can regard them as a fixed macro

DSP with ACIN*/BCIN*/PCIN* connected to other DSP should be a Macro

CARRY with CIN connected to other DSP should be a Macro

BRAM with CAS* connected to other BRAM should be a Macro

CARRY with external input from outside of CLB will occupy specific LUT too.

for RAM32X1D macro, we should place some FFs connected to the LUTRAMs first.

 if any of the LUTs are configured as distributed RAM within a SLICEM, 
 then the other three LUTs in the same half (A to D or E to H) must also be used as distributed RAM, 
 or not be used. The other half can be used as regular LUTs, but cannot be used as SRLs

 only when READ ADDRESS and WRITE ADDRESS are all the same, the LUTRAM can share LUT6s in SLICEM
 ERROR: [Vivado 12-1409] Cannot set loc and bel property of instance(s) 
	to bel F5LUT. Two RAM symbols can not share a LUT site if two RAM symbols are not also sharing the H LUT site. There are fewer than two RAM symbols in the H LUT site

If only write address is the same, the LUTRAMs can share a SLICEM but cannot overlap on the same LUT6

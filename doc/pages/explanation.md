# Implementation Explanation {#explanation}

Here, we will explain the placement flow by going through the functionality of the major modules in the placer. Of course, you can also make full use of the Doxygen diagram to trace the call graphs to understand their relationship. We try to avoid multi-level class during implementation so it is easier for beginners to trace the call graphs.

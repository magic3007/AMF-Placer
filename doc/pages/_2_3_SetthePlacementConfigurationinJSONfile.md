# Set the Placement Configuration in JSON file


By checking the content of the JSON file in the command argument above, you may notice the major settings of our placer. 
Generally, we need to let the placer know where are the data of the design and devices, whether the placer should dump some log text/archieve files for further checking or evaluation, and some parameters related to the algorithms in the placer.

Below, we explain some of the settings. If users target at Xilinx VCU108, users may only need to change the parameters related to the design benchmark, which we mark with \[DESIGN\]. We also mark others parameters with \[DEVICE\], \[DEBUG\] and \[PLACER\]. Some optional parameters can be disable by commenting out by "//". Please be aware that no matter the value types are string or not, the value should be wrapper by " " as syntax requirement.
